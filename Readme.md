# Discount Jira

Discount Jira is just that, a barebones clone of Jira.

I had a few reasons for creating this:

1. Jira is expensive.
2. Trello doesn't have a few features that I feel are helpful when following an AGILE workflow with a team.
3. I wanted something that I could add on to whenever the need arose.
4. I wanted to dig into ASP<span><span/>.NET Core to build the backend REST Api.

## Demo

View the application live at **notareallink<span></span>.com**

## Tech Used

### Backend

- C# and ASP<span><span/>.NET Core
- .NET Identity for Auth
- Entity Framework for an ORM
- PostgreSql
- MediatR
- SignalR for PubSub (realtime comments)

### Frontend

- React (create-react-app)
  - _This may change in the future_
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS

## Installing Discount Jira

Docker:

1. Clone the repo
2. (still working on this)
